# bellly-button-challenge
Using the D3 Javascript library to generate an interactive dashboard to explore the belly button biodiversity dataset.
# Summary
This Module 14 Challenge involves building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. This dataset catalogs the microbes that colonise human navels, revealing that a small number of microbial species are common among more than 70% of people, while the majority are relatively rare.

# Objectives:

Data Visualisation: Utilize the D3 library to read in a JSON dataset and create interactive visualizations.

Horizontal Bar Chart: Displays the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for each individual with dropdown selection.
Bubble Chart: Visualizes all OTUs for each individual with customizable markers for size and color.
Metadata Panel: Displays demographic information for each individual.
Interactivity: Ensure that all visualizations update when a new sample is selected, providing a dynamic user experience.

This challenge demonstrates proficiency in data handling, visualisation, and web deployment, showcasing the ability to create informative and interactive data-driven applications.
